This challenge of the bootcamp was to create a work day scheduler that alows a user to save events for each hour of the day.<br><br>
The work day scheduler has the following functionality:<br>

<li>At the top (under the header) it shows the current full date and time.<br>
<li>Presented with time blocks for standard business hours.<br>
<li>The time blocks are color graded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.<br>
<li>Great practice to learn css frameworks and javascript libraries.<br>
<li>Another challenge to strengthen our knowledge of saving data in local storage.<br><br>
The following images shows the web application's appearance and functionality:<br><br>
